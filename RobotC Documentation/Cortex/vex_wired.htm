    <p>This  is a guide for setting up the VEX Cortex using the USB A-to-A cable. These steps are required the first time you use your computer to program a specific VEX Cortex, or after you've upated ROBOTC to the latest verstion. Once you've successfully completed these steps you can
      download your own programs without revisiting them. <strong>Note: Administrative privileges are required for some of these steps.</strong></p>

  <h2><br />
    Note: Driver Installation</h2>
  <div class="articles">
    <p>ROBOTC 3.05 and later automatically installs the necessary drivers for the VEX Cortex, VEXnet Joysticks, and USB-to-Serial Programming cable. If you need to download the drivers for troubleshooting purposes, you can still find them at <a href="http://www.robotc.net/download/cortex/" target="_blank">www.ROBOTC.net/download/cortex.<br />

</div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2><br />
    Step 1: Connect the Cortex to your PC</h2>
  <div class="articles">
    <p>Connect the VEX Cortex directly to a USB port on your computer using the USB A-to-A cable. Allow a few seconds for Windows to recognize the device.</p>
<p><img src="3_5_images/connect.JPG" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Connect a 7.2V Robot battery to the Cortex and move the POWER switch to the ON position. Optionally, you can connect two motors to MOTOR Ports 2 and 3 for testing a sample program later in the sequence. You can connect 3-wire motors directly, or the newer 2-wire motors using Motor Controller 29 cables.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/battery_motors.JPG" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
    <p>Note: Technically, the battery is not necessary for downloading Master CPU Firmware and ROBOTC Firmware, but it has helped in cases where the USB ports on the computer provide too little power to facilitate a reliable connection to the Cortex.</p>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <hr />
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Step 2: Platform Type and Communication Port</h2>
  <div class="articles">
    <p>Specify that you are using the Cortex and how it is connected to your computer in ROBOTC. Go to Robot &gt; Platform Type &gt; Innovation First (IFI) and select &quot;<strong>VEX 2.0 Cortex</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Natural Language (VEX Cortex)</strong>&quot;.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/Screenshot-2012-01-06_12.39.36.png" alt="" width="652" height="327" /></p>
    <p>Note: You should choose &quot;<strong>VEX 2.0 Cortex</strong>&quot; if you plan on programming using the standard ROBOTC language. Choose &quot;<strong>Natural Language (VEX Cortex)</strong>&quot; if you want to take advantage of the Natural Language commands in ROBOTC.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Then go to View and choose Select Communication Port.</p>
    <p><img src="images/comm port.png" alt="" width="243" height="260" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Select Communications Port for Platforms window  will appear. From the Communications Port drop down list, you should see  &quot;Automatic Selection&quot; and one of two additional options:    </p>
    <p>If your VEX Cortex is in &quot;bootload mode&quot; or running an older (2.x) version of the Master CPU Firmware, it will appear as a &quot;USB Wired Cable&quot; option in the list.</p>
    <p><img src="images/comm port select.png" alt="" width="536" height="261" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If your VEX Cortex is running a newer (3.x) version of the Master CPU Firmware, it will appear as a &quot;Vex Robotics Comm Port&quot; in the list.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/Screenshot-2012-01-06_12.44.29.png" alt="" width="536" height="261" /></p>
<p>Make sure that &quot;Automatic Selection&quot; or one of the two legitimate options is selected. If  you ever plan on programming your robot wirelessly over VEXnet, choosing &quot;Automatic Selection&quot;  is recommended. Press OK to save your choice.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Important: If the &quot;USB Wired Cable&quot; or &quot;Vex Robotics Comm Port&quot; options do not appear in the drop down menu when a VEX Cortex is connected, this may indicate that Windows has not recognized the device or access to it is blocked. Ensure that the VEX Cortex Device Driver was successfully installed with Administrative Privileges, disconnect and reconnect your Cortex from the computer, and press &quot;Refresh List&quot; to force ROBOTC to repopulate the list. <br />
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2><br />
    Step 3: Updating VEX Cortex Firmware</h2>
  <div class="articles">
    <p>Go to Robot &gt; Download Firmware  and select &quot;Automatically Update VEX Cortex&quot;.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/Screenshot-2012-01-06_12.58.27.png" alt="" width="527" height="329" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A message will appear, informing you that the software will update your Cortex to the latest Master CPU and ROBOTC Firmware files. Press OK to begin the process.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/ROBOTC_Message-2012-01-06_12.58.37.png" alt="" width="417" height="178" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A Download Progress window will appear, showing the progress of the Master CPU Firmware download. </p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/Download_Progress-2012-01-06_12.59.09.png" alt="" width="535" height="132" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When the Master CPU Firmware download is complete, a ROBOTC Message will appear and inform you that it will now update the ROBOTC firmware, if needed. Press OK to continue the process.</p>
<p><img src="3_5_images/ROBOTC_Message-2012-01-06_12.59.37.png" alt="" width="408" height="165" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note: If this is the first time a VEX Cortex running the 3.x Master CPU Firmware has been connected to your computer, Windows will recognize it as  a new device, and  may prompt you to verify the new hardware installation. Press Continue or Continue Anyway to complete the installation.</p>
    <p><img src="images/found new hardware 4.png" alt="" width="556" height="419" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If your ROBOTC Firmware is out-of-date, another Download Progress window will appear and begin the ROBOTC Firmware download. </p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/Download_Progress-2012-01-06_13.00.34.png" alt="" width="535" height="132" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When the download completes, another ROBOTC Message will appear. Press OK to complete the process.</p>
    <p><img src="3_5_images/ROBOTC_Message-2012-01-06_13.00.00.png" alt="" width="374" height="145" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Notes: </p>
    <p>Once this step is complete, you should no longer need Administrative privileges on your computer; you should be able to download Master CPU Firmware, ROBOTC firmware, and ROBOTC programs in a permissions-restricted account. Only future updates to ROBOTC and the VEX Cortex Device Driver will require Administrative privileges. Exception: On some computers, Windows may prompt you to &quot;install new hardware&quot; each time the Cortex is plugged in on a different USB port. To alleviate the issue, connect the updated VEX Cortex on each USB port as an administrator (no need to redownload firmware), or dedicate one USB port for communication with the VEX Cortex.</p>
    <p><strong>You only need to download the  Firmware once</strong>, when you first start using a VEX Cortex with ROBOTC, or when you upgrade to a newer version of ROBOTC. You do not need to re-download the  firmware every time you want to download code. If the download fails, disconnect the VEX Cortex from your computer and turn it off. Then reconnect it to the computer, allow a few seconds to ensure that Windows recognizes it, turn it on, and try downloading the  firmware again. </p>
    <p>If you are having trouble with the Automatic Firmware Download, you can <a href="vex_wired_manual.htm">follow these steps to manually download the firmware</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <br />
  <h2>Step 4: Downloading and Running Code</h2>
  <div class="articles">
    <p>ROBOTC contains a large library of sample programs to help you get started. These sample programs can be downloaded to your VEX Cortex using the USB A-to-A cable, or using a wireless VEXnet connection.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The VEX Cortex Communication Mode controls how ROBOTC downloads 
      programs to your Cortex, as well as what types of connections your Cortex checks for when
      it is powered on. Confirm that your VEX Cortex Communication Mode is set to &quot;VEXnet or USB&quot; or &quot;USB Only&quot;. &quot;<strong>USB Only</strong>&quot; is the recommended method for wired-only programming. <br />
      <img src="3_5_images/Screenshot-2012-01-06_13.15.48.png" alt="" width="444" height="284" /><br />
      Option 1: VEXnet or USB<br />
      With this option selected, ROBOTC will download  programs to your
      Cortex using a VEXnet or USB connection. In this mode, when the Cortex is powered ON <strong>it
      will look for a VEXnet or USB connection for up to 15 seconds before running your program</strong>.
      (The Communication Port &gt; Automatic Selection option in the ROBOTC Preferences should be selected if you plan on
      switching between VEXnet and USB as your download method.)<br />
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Option 2: USB Only</strong><br />
      With this option selected, ROBOTC will download programs to your Cortex
      using only the USB connection. In this mode, when the Cortex is powered ON it will
      immediately run your program. This option will NOT work if you are using the VEXnet
      Joysticks to download to the Cortex, or remotely control it.</p>
    <p><br />
      Option 3: Competition (VEXnet)<br />
      This option disables the ROBOTC debugger, and is not recommended for classroom use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To open a sample program, go to File &gt; Open Sample Program.</p>
    <p><img src="images/program 2.png" alt="" width="244" height="112" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Navigate to the Basic Movement folder and open &quot;Moving Forward.c&quot;.</p>
    <p><img src="images/program 1.png" alt="" width="678" height="434" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Make sure that your robot is connected to the computer and turned ON. Then go to Robot &gt; Compile and Download Program.</p>
    <p><img src="images/compile.png" alt="" width="313" height="100" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Important Note:
      The VEX Cortex Communication Mode is stored in ROBOTC and on the Cortex. If you
      change the setting, it gets transferred to the Cortex the next time you download a program. The Cortex must be power cycled (disconnected from the computer, turned fully off, and then back on)
      before the change will take effect.</p>
    <p><img src="images/download_method_chage.png" alt="" width="416" height="282" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Download Progress window will appear while the program is downloading to the Cortex.</p>
    <p><img src="images/robotc_download.png" alt="" width="533" height="139" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When the Download Progress window closes, the Program Debug window will appear. You can run your program by pressing the &quot;Start&quot; button, or by disconnecting the robot and turning it OFF and back ON.</p>
    <p><img src="images/program_debug.png" alt="" width="801" height="538" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With the sample program above, you should observe motors plugged into Ports 2 and 3 spinning for 3 seconds.</p>
